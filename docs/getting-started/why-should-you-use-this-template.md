# Why should you use this template ?

## Tasks within notes, with links to other notes

It embraces many relevant and high level productivity concepts alongside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)'s [powerful note linking feature](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Link+notes) while still being usable as a simple "I create a simple daily checklist with a few notes" in case of existential crisis. â†’ That means the system will **last**.

## Offline access and data possession

Of course using Obsidian also mean **offline access** and **data possession**. You can sync your data yourself using [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin. If the mobile (android) version doesn't work the way you want despite the plugin active development, you can follow one of my guides :

- [One using cron jobs to sync at regular intervals](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/using-git-to-sync-your-obsidian-vault-on-android-devices/)
- [Another one that sync at Obsidian's app startup](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/how-to-use-obsidian-git-sync-on-android/)

Or just pay for the encrypted [obsidian-sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) official plugin.
