# Requirements

## Required apps and accounts

- [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/download).
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/downloads) (free is enough) for an **easy**, **fast** and accessible inbox on any of your devices.
- [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) for read-it-later and bookmark manager with automated markdown conversion for offline use.
- [Github](https://github.com/) account for hosting your website on Github Pages.

## Optional apps and accounts

- [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com/) if you want to separate your organisation (Obsidian) from your daily execution (Super Productivity).
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) account if you want to add some Google Calendar integration to your periodic notes. *Note: This will not be explained in the docs as this was used in [0.0.1 version](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/obsidian-workflow-template/releases/tag/0.0.1) of the template only. But you can do it yourself using [obsidian-google-calendar plugin](https://github.com/YukiGasai/obsidian-google-calendar) or [obsidian-custom-frames plugin](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames)*
