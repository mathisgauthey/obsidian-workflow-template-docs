# Installation

## How to install ?

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/obsidian-workflow-template/releases) of the repository and download the latest release.
2. Extract the archive in your desired vault location (eg:`C:\Users\USER_NAME\Documents`).
3. Rename the folder to your desired `VAULT_NAME`.
4. You can safely remove the `README.md` file, the `LICENCE` file and the `.github` folder. They are useless for you.
5. Open Obsidian and select that folder as a vault.
6. Go to the community plugin tab and turn off `Restricted Mode` to activate the vault plugins.

## How to login to plugins ?

1. [Log in to the obsidian-todoist plugin](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin#usage) by using your [Todoist API token](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).
2. [Log in to the obsidian-omnivore plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore#installation) by using your [Omnivore API key](https://omnivore.app/settings/api).

## How to update ?

To be honest, I don't plan on updating this project anymore except by resolving user issues. So you should not have to update it.
