# Journaling

## Write journal entries

Every daily and periodic notes has a `Journal ðŸ““` section. You can add your journal entries here.

In daily notes, the `mood` inline field is a `1-5` notation for the day, from really bad (1) to genial day (5).

## Query journal entries

The `Journal YYYY ðŸ““.md` file at the root of your vault contains a beaufitul heatmap-calendar from the obsidian-heatmap-calendar plugin.

There's also a query that shows every journal entries from the current year, allowing you to search for a word inside every journal entries at once in `obsidian reading view`.
