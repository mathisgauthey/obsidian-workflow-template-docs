# Passions Backlog üéÆ

## What is the Passions Backlog üéÆ ?

The passions backlog is a giant kanban board that allows you to track your passions and media consumption.

```txt
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wishlist -> Things you want to do
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Possessions -> Things you have, or have the resources to do
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backlog -> Next things you want to do
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doing -> Things you're currently doing on your own
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doing On The Go -> Things you're currently doing on your own, but easily transportable (eg: books)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doing Couple -> Watching a show with your GF ? There you go.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Doing Friends -> Playing with the boys ? There you go.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024 -> The next are self explicit, I enjoy seeing things I've done by year.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2023
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2022
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Before 2022 -> That's when I transitionned to Obsidian.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Abandonned -> At least you tried...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Never Tried, Never Will -> You got it, you have it, but you'll never do it.
```

## How to use it ?

I'd recommend adding items simply using the obsidian-kanban view and moving them across columns.

But if you want extra data during your daily `Logs ü™µ`, I also recommend going into `markdown mode` for creating items. That'll add a `‚ûï CREATION_DATE`.

If you finish something, you can add a `‚úÖ COMPLETION_DATE` inline field before moving it to the year column. Or if you're already in `markdown mode`, toggling the task will do it.

Same goes for the `‚ùå CANCELLED_DATE` inline field before moving items to `Abandonned` or `Never Tried, Never Will`.

## How to query it ?

There's a small query in your daily note that shows you the items inside columns that contains the word `Doing`. That way you can see what you can currently do each day.
