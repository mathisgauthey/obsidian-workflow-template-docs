# Tasks and projects management

## The Daily Note

The Daily Note is the main part of your workflow. It has :

- Links to access higher periods
- Links to access previous and next days
- Today ☀️ section -> Contains tasks with a `happens date` set to today or before, or tasks in progress. Tasks are then grouped by projects or tasks, and by due or overdue. You also get a small `#next` actions querry.
- Notes 📝 section -> For adding notes and tasks as `one-off tasks`. You also have a `todoist-inbox-query` to see easily if you have [captured](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#capture) items to [clarify](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#clarify).
- Dashboard 🗺️ section -> Multiple queries to see overdue, do today, upcoming in the next 30 days, recurring tasks, next actions, projects,  waiting for tasks, delegated tasks, and your focus and goals.
- Passions 🎮 section -> A query that get your current passions and media from your `Passions Backlog 🎮` kanban board. It uses the `Doing` keyword in titles to get the current passions and media.
- Logs 🪵 section -> A query that get your created tasks and projects as well as your tasks and projects done today.
- Daily Focus 🔥 & Goals 🎯 section -> Add your daily focuses and goals here as markdown tasks. A tag `#focus` or `#goals` is required.
- Journal 📓 section -> Add your journal entries here. The `mood` inline field is a `1-5` notation for the day, from really bad (1) to genial day (5).

## The Periodic Notes

You get almost the same sections as the daily notes, but you also have :

- A [modified Tasks-Calendar](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar) in the Dashboard 🗺️ in the weekly and monthly notes.
- Underground 🚇 section -> Queries that have projects grouped by areas, usefull when trying to balance workload. You also get the unplanned and on hold tasks and projects queries.
