- 🗃️ [P.A.R.A](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)[^1] folder organisation based on file actionability.
- ✅ [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)[^2] task management on par with a [full Todoist setup](https://todoist.com/fr/productivity-methods/getting-things-done), but with a simple and natural way of **writing tasks alongside notes**. You also get to keep your project tasks, notes and files archives when you finish a project, allowing you to access these informations in the future.
- 📅 Daily notes for task management, periodic notes for projects management (week, month, quarter and year).
- 📓 Journal section for each daily and periodic notes to write about anything that happened during a certain period of time.
- 🎮 Media backlog Kanban board for tracking books, shows, movies or video games backlog, consuming media at the right pace, and archiving what you do. All without proprietary online services that hold you data.

    2. Highlight and take reference notes using [Omnivore app](https://omnivore.app/) or directly inside your vault using a simple markdown file.
    3. Write literature notes to summarise the source informations.
    4. Write permanent notes from key concepts directly inside literature notes using wiki-links.
